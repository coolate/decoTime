# decoTime
Arduino code for DecoTime.
DecoTime is my Art Deco styled timer. It is powered by an Arduino driving two x27 168 or switec X25 stepper motors moving the needles. It also uses a MCP23S17 to drive the LEDs and take input from the two rotary encoders. A solenoid rings the bell when finished and the top LED flashes. It can be run off batteries(alkaline or NiMh), or usb. It also has an expansion port to use I2C with power. You can find the knobs, battery pack, and needles in my other uploads on thingiverse.

You can read all about it in great detail on my website, including schematics and directions.
